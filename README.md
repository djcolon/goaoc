# Golang Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022/

My solutions to advent of code 2022, used to learn go.

Rather than trying to get the answer as quickly as possible, I'll use this to
explore the language. I may do slightly unnecessary or outlandish things to try
out parts of the language. I'll make extensive use of TDD, and write code that
is overblown for the simple puzzles. I will aim to write code that is in the
style I'd aim for in production (within the confines of learning a new
language).
All implementations are my original work, with no solutions taken from the internet/others.
